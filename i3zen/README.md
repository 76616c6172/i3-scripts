I made a post on [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6xbdtk/oci3_i3zen/) where you can view an animated gif of *i3zen* in action.

*******************************
Put the window between two ghosts (centered).
if the window already is "zen", move it back to its
original workspace. If the window is not in zen but
another window is, both of them will be zen in a tabbed
container.

**usage**  
`$ i3zen [OPTION] ARGUMENT`

| **option** | **argument** | **function**     
|:-------|:---------|:---------------------------|
| -v     |          | show version info and exit |
| -h     |          | show this help and exit    |

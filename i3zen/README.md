put your windows in a zen mode for a zen mood
----------------------------------------

When run, this script puts the active window between two ghosts (centered). if the window already is "zen", move it back to its original workspace. If the window is not in zen but another window is, both of them will be zen in a tabbed container.

I made a post on [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6xbdtk/oci3_i3zen/) where you can view an animated gif of *i3zen* in action.

dependencies

[i3get](/i3ass/i3get) | to identify and the current window

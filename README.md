And some of the scripts are rather complex. The links in the
table below, will take you to the wiki page for the script.


|**file**  |     **function**          |
|:---------|:--------------------------|
|[i3flip] | Tabswitching done right
|[i3fyra] | An advanced, simple grid-based tiling layout
|[i3get] | prints info about a specific window to stdout
|[i3gw] | a ghost window wrapper for i3wm
|[i3king] | window ruler
|[i3Kornhe] | move and resize windows gracefully
|[i3list] | list information about the current i3 session.
|[i3menu] | Adds more features to rofi when used in i3wm
|[i3run] | Run, Raise or hide windows in i3wm
|[i3var] | Set or get a i3 variable
|[i3viswiz] | Professional window focus for i3wm

EXAMPLES
--------

Execute a script with the `--help` flag to display help
about the command.

`i3get --help` display [i3get] help  
`i3get --version` display [i3get] version  
`man i3get` show [i3get] man page  
`i3ass` show version info for all scripts and dependencies.

## updates

#### [i3king]

Added support for **window_role** criteria.

Changed internal field separator to US (x1F). This will fix
issues related to windows with properties containg the old
field separator (`:`).

Fixed issue where windows whose target properties contained
a hyphen (`-`) wasn't recognized by  GLOBAL or DEFAULT
rules.

Sending USR1 to the i3king process will restart i3king.
Hint:  
`kill -USR1 $(< "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/i3ass/i3king.pid")`

## known issues

**THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR i3-gaps**  
some scripts might still work with i3-gaps, but consider that *Happy little accidentsâ„¢*

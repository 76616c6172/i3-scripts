# i3ass - i3 assistance scripts 

This is a collection of scripts I have made to assist the
usage of the windowmanager known as [i3wm].

## installation

If you are using **Arch linux**, you can install the i3ass
package from [AUR].  

Or follow the instructions below to install from source:  

(*configure the installation destination in the Makefile,
if needed*)

``` text
$ git clone https://github.com/budlabs/i3ass.git
$ cd i3ass
# make install
$ i3ass
i3ass - version: 0.002
updated: 2018-10-18 by budRich

bash      [INSTALLED]
gawk      [INSTALLED]
sed       [INSTALLED]
xdotool   [INSTALLED]
```


All the scripts that will be installed are located in the
`src` directory of this repo, so you can also just add that
directory or the scripts to your **$PATH**.  

---

There is no oneline way to describe what **i3ass** does.
And some of the scripts are rather complex. The links in the
table below, will take you to the wiki page for the script.

|**file**  |     **function**          |
|:---------|:--------------------------|
|[i3flip] | Tabswitching done right
|[i3fyra] | An advanced, simple grid-based tiling layout
|[i3get] | Boilerplate and template maker for bash scripts
|[i3gw] | a ghost window wrapper for i3wm
|[i3Kornhe] | move and resize windows gracefully
|[i3list] | list information about the current i3 session.
|[i3menu] | Adds more features to rofi when used in i3wm
|[i3run] | Run, Raise or hide windows in i3wm
|[i3var] | Set or get a i3 variable
|[i3viswiz] | Professional window focus for i3wm

EXAMPLES
--------
Execute a script with the `--help` flag to display help
about the command.

`i3get --help` display [i3get] help  
`i3get --version` display [i3get] version  
`man i3get` show [i3get] man page  
`i3ass` show version info for all scripts and dependencies.
## updates

### 2019.02.07.06

Added [i3menu] which is an improved version of the script
`oneliner` that has been available in the **budlabs
organization** for some time. I figured i include it with
**i3ass** instead, since it is very *i3 focused*, see the
wiki for more info.  

Refactored [i3list] to make it easier to manage and fixed a
small issue that resulted in splits being reported with the
wrong size if the *main container* of the split was hidden.
The issue had never caused any serious issues, but now that
it is fixed I experience faster creation of the [i3fyra]
layout, it also made some functions in the new script
[i3menu] work as expected.

### 2019.01.30.2


Fixed two bugs (#46,#47) in [i3fyra] and [i3list]. `--hide`
in [i3fyra] now works again. The issue in [i3list] was
affecting targeted windows and their floating state, 
resulting in unpredictable behavior when  fi summoning a
window from the scratchpad.  All should be good now thanks
to user **APotOfSoup** who reported and found the solution
to both these issues. (the cause was the major refactoring
and adaptation of the codebase to the `bashsbud` framework,
introduced in the last release).

### 2019.01.15.0


Removed execution of `i3ass` command from the **Makefile**,
and added `make uninstall` to the **PKGBUILD** on [AUR]. To
improve the installation process. (*thanks to Johan for
reporting issue with i3ass command in makefil*).


## known issues

`i3-msg restart` breaks [i3fyra], try to use `i3-msg
reload` instead (*it's faster and usually works just as good
as restart*).

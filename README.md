i3ass - Assistance for i3wm, mostly bash
========================================

|scripts|function|
|:------|:-------|
|i3fyra |An advanced simple layout         |
|i3run  |Run, Raise or hide a window       |
|i3get  |Get information about i3          |
|i3cast |Create and upload screenrecordings|
|i3list |Get lots of information about i3  |
|i3gw   |Ghost window wrapper script       |
|i3mtm  |Move window to a chosen mark      |
|i3term |Launch a program inside a terminal|
|i3zen  |Move a window to the zenter       |

This is a bunch of scripts that I've made for the amazing window manager i3wm. Some of them are more proof of concepts or pure novelty stuff that I've done for funs (`i3zen`,`i3cast`,`i3mtm`). Some of them are actually pretty useful (`i3run`,`i3get`,`i3list`). And one of them completely changes the way i3 behaves and works (`i3fyra`).

I hope you can find some use for them, at least inspiration.

Just download the scripts, make them executable and run:  
`SCRIPTNAME -h` for instructions on how to use the desired script.

Most of them have some kind of dependency. But only i3cast and i3mtm have dependencies outside of this folder.  

Check out my youtube series Let's Linux where If you want to see the scripts in action.

mtm = Move To Mark
----------------------

When launched without flags, `i3mtm` checks
floating status of current window. If it is tiled, the window becomes floating. if it is floating, a search for marks is done if no marks are found, window becomes tiled. otherwise a dmenu asks for a mark to move window to. if no selection is made, window is tiled but not moved. otherwise window is tiled and moved to selected mark.

with `-m` flag window is treaded as if it was floating even if it is tiled. (menu is forced)

examples
--------
you could replace your `floating toggle` binding with this: 

    bindsym Mod3+f exec --no-startup-id exec i3mtm      
    bindsym Mod3+Shift+f exec --no-startup-id exec i3mtm -m

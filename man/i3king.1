.PP
\fB\fCi3king\fR - window ruler

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.RS

.nf
i3king --config|-c FILE
i3king --json JSON [--verbose] [--dryrun] [--log FILE]
i3king --help|-h
i3king --version|-v

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
i3king will match all \fBnew\fP windows against the
rules defined in \fBI3_KING_RULE_FILE\fP
(\fI\fB\fC~/.config/i3king/rules\fR\fP). If a rule matches
the created window, the command associated with
the rule will get passed to \fB\fCi3-msg\fR\&.

.PP
The criterias a window can get matched against
are
.br
- \fBclass\fP

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinstance\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtitle\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwindow_type\fP

.RE

.PP
It is also possible to use \fBGLOBAL\fP rules which
will match any windows. But each global rules can
have a \fBblack\fPlist with windows that will not
trigger that rule.

.PP
A variant of the GLOBAL rule is \fBDEFAULT\fP
rules, which works exactly like GLOBAL rules,
except they only get triggered if the window
didn't match any \fI"normal"\fP rules (regular GLOBAL
rules are normal).

.PP
Just like in the i3 config the \fB\fCset\fR directive is
available, so you can make variables.

.PP
Two built in magic variables are avaible in the
config:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
$INSTANCE
.IP \(bu 2
$CLASS

.RE

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS

.nf
GLOBAL \\
  class=URxvt instance=htop, \\
  instance=firefox
    title_format $INSTANCE

.fi
.RE

.PP
The above rule will set the title_format to the
instance name of all windows, except a URxvt
window with the instance name htop, and firefox
windows.

.PP
If $I3_KING_RULES_FILE doesn't exist, a example
rule file will get created. See that file for
details about the syntax.

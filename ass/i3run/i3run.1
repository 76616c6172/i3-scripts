.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCi3run\fR let's you use one command for multiple
functions related to the same window identified by
a given criteria.

.PP
\fB\fCi3run\fR will take different action depending on
the state of the searched window:

.TS
allbox;
l l 
l l .
\fB\fC\fBtarget window state\fP\fR	\fB\fC\fBaction\fP\fR
T{
Active and not handled by i3fyra
T}	hide
Active and handled by i3fyra	T{
hide container, if not \fB\fC\-g\fR is set
T}
Handled by i3fyra and hidden	show container, activate
T{
Not handled by i3fyra and hidden
T}	show window, activate
Not on current workspace	T{
goto workspace or show if \fB\fC\-s\fR is set
T}
Not found	execute command (\fB\fC\-e\fR)
.TE

.PP
Hidden in this context,  means that window is on
the scratchpad. Show in this context means,  move
window to current workspace.

.PP
It is important that \fB\fC\-e\fR \fICOMMAND\fP is last of
the options.  \fB\fC\-e\fR is optional, if no \fICOMMAND\fP is
passed and no window is found,  nothing happens.
It is also important that \fICOMMAND\fP will spawn a
window matching the criteria,  otherwise the
script will get stuck in a loop waiting for the
window to appear.
